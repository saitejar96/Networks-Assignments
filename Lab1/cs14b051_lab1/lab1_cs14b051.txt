The parent folder contains four files- 
udpclient.c
udpserver.c
tcpclient.c
tcpserver.c

All files can be compiled using [gcc -o --executable-name-- --C-filename--]
**Ignore warnings

Upon running make four executables are created-
UDPclient
UDPserver
TCPclient
TCPserver

The server files can be run using [./**Pserver --port no.--]
The client files can be run using [./**Pclient --host address-- --port no.--]

Upon running the client files, the client program establishes a connection and sends a message "saiteja" to the server 1000 times and finally prints out the average of time taken to receive the echo from the server. 
Timing is taken care of inside the program using clock() function from time.h

Also server and client info are shown in the terminals appropriately.

Observations-
Avg time for tcp server client = 0.000018 s
Avg time for udp server client = 0.000013 s 

UDP is faster than TCP due to lack of the three way handshake.
