This submission folder has-
->one .java files
->a Makefile
->a README file
->a COMMENTS file
->a BASH script file
->a technical report
->folder containing test script files.

Upon running make, three .class files are created-
->Slot.class
->Packet.class
->Node.class
->SlottedAloha2.class

The Tests folder contains script.log file which can be used to read the terminal session used for testing.

The SlottedAloha2.class is run using java SlottedAloha2 and the following arguments
1. “-N integer”: number of users sharing the channel
2. “-W integer”: specifies initial value of Collision Window size for all nodes (W (i); default: 2).
3. “-p double”: specifies PACKET GEN RATE (p): probability of packet generation per unit
time per node
4. “-M integer”: MAX PACKETS

Upon running the hello.sh BASH script file, it generates outputs using N=50,W in {2,4} and p in {0.01,0.02,0.03,0.05,0.10}
